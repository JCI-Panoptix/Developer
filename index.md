## Welcome to the Panoptix Developer Center
This is your opportunity to start adding to the rapidly growing universe of building efficiency solutions. We provide you with an ever-expanding set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and a community to collaborate with us and other developers. The Panoptix APIs use Representational State Transfer (REST) for getting data from the Panoptix platform. After connecting your app to [Panoptix](https://www.panoptix.com) you will be able to market and sell it in the [marketplace](https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix/apps), expanding your market reach to include the entire Panoptix customer base.

### The Panoptix Application Developer Program
The PanoptixÂ® App Developer Program provides the framework for the development or integration of apps with the Panoptix Platform.

* We provide with you the tools and the APIs
* You develop a new app, or integrate an existing one
* You can play with the API integration with our sandbox
* You submit the app for certification
* The app is listed on our marketplace. 
* Customers can view and purchase your app

**It couldn't be easier.**
