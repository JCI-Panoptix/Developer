<p>This is your opportunity to start adding to the rapidly growing universe of building efficiency solutions. 
We provide you with an ever-expanding set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and a community to collaborate 
with us and other developers. The Panoptix APIs use Representational State Transfer (REST) for getting data from the 
Panoptix platform. After connecting your app to <a href="https://www.panoptix.com">Panoptix</a> you will be able to market
and sell it in the <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix/apps">marketplace</a>, expanding your market reach to include the entire Panoptix customer base.</p>
